# Lab-2: identifying ML problems, selecting open datasets, and Drawing a methodology diagram
The machine learning problem is to predict the unemployment rate. The target variable is a numerical value representing the unemployment rate for various regions. This is a regression problem, and the model is expected to learn how the unemployment rate changes over time, by age group, region, and gender, to predict the unemployment rate for the future.
